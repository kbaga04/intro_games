# Random Password Generator

A Python program that I had developed to generate random strong passwords. Every password is about 15-20 characters long with the following characteristics:
1. A mix of uppercase and lowercase characters
2. A minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 special characters (The password will be invalid if the website doesn't allow symbols in password)
3. Numbers from 0-9 occuring a minimum of 2 times and a maximum of 8 times

Due to the use of the random module in this program, all passwords are randomly generated, making them secure
